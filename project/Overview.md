# A Network Analysis of Game of Thrones

Game of Thrones is the hugely popular television series by HBO based on the (also) hugely popular book series <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> by George R.R. Martin. In this notebook, we will analyze the co-occurrence network of the characters in the  Game of Thrones books. Here, two characters are considered to co-occur if their names appear in the vicinity of 15 words from one another in the books. </p>

# Comparing Search Interest with Google Trends

<p>While I'm not a fan nor a hater of the Kardashians and Jenners, the polarizing family intrigues me. Why? Their marketing prowess. Say what you will about them and what they stand for, they are great at the hype game. Everything they touch turns to content.</p>
<p>The sisters in particular over the past decade have been especially productive in this regard. Let's get some facts straight. I consider the "sisters" to be the following daughters of Kris Jenner. Three from her first marriage, and two from her second marriage.
We're here to explore the data underneath the hype, and we'll do it using search interest data from Google Trends. We'll recreate the Google Trends plot to visualize their ups and downs over time, then make a few custom plots of our own. And we'll answer the big question: <strong>is Kim even the most famous sister anymore?</strong></p>

# Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

This is Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital. If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about <em>childbed fever</em>: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and <em>wash their hands</em>!</p>
<p>In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of <em>handwashing</em>

# Exploring the Evolution of Linux

<p>Version control repositories like CVS, Subversion or Git can be a real gold mine for software developers. They contain every change to the source code including the date (the "when"), the responsible developer (the "who"), as well as a little message that describes the intention (the "what") of a change.</p>
<p>In this notebook, we will analyze the evolution of a very famous open-source project &ndash; the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel is the heart of some Linux distributions like Debian, Ubuntu or CentOS. Our dataset at hand contains the history of kernel development of almost 13 years (early 2005 - late 2017). We get some insights into the work of the development efforts by </p>
<ul>
<li>identifying the TOP 10 contributors and</li>
<li>visualizing the commits over the years.</li>
</ul>

# Exploring 67 years of LEGO

<p>Everyone loves Lego (unless you ever stepped on one). Did you know by the way that "Lego" was derived from the Danish phrase leg godt, which means "play well"? Unless you speak Danish, probably not. </p>
<p>In this project, we will analyze a fascinating dataset on every single lego block that has ever been built!</p>

# Recreating Jon Snow's Ghost Map

<p>Dr. John Snow (1813-1858) was a famous British physician and is widely recognized as a legendary figure in the history of public health and a leading pioneer in the development of anesthesia. Some even say one of the greatest physicians of all time.</p>
<p>As a leading advocate of both anesthesia and hygienic practices in medicine, he not only experimented with ether and chloroform but also designed a mask and method how to administer it. He personally administered chloroform to Queen Victoria during the births of her eighth and ninth children, in 1853 and 1857, which assured a growing public acceptance of the use of anesthetics during childbirth.</p>
<p>But, as we will show later, not all his life was just a success. John Snow is now also recognized as one of the founders of modern epidemiology <em>(some also consider him as the founder of data visualization, spatial analysis, data science in general, and many other related fields)</em> for his scientific and pretty modern data approach in identifying the source of a cholera outbreak in Soho, London in 1854, but it wasn't always like this. In fact, for a long time, he was simply ignored by the scientific community and currently is very often mythified. </p>
<p>In this notebook, we're not only going to rediscover his "data story", but reanalyze the data that he collected in 1854 and recreate his famous map (also called The Ghost Map).</p>

# Risk and Returns, The Sharpe Ratio

<p>An investment may make sense if we expect it to return more money than it costs. But returns are only part of the story because they are risky - there may be a range of possible outcomes. How does one compare different investments that may deliver similar results on average, but exhibit different levels of risks?</p>
<p>Enter William Sharpe. He introduced the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/art/sr/sr.htm"><em>reward-to-variability ratio</em></a> in 1966 that soon came to be called the Sharpe Ratio. It compares the expected returns for two investment opportunities and calculates the additional return per unit of risk an investor could obtain by choosing one over the other. In particular, it looks at the difference in returns for two investments and compares the average difference to the standard deviation (as a measure of risk) of this difference. A higher Sharpe ratio means that the reward will be higher for a given amount of risk. It is common to compare a specific opportunity against a benchmark that represents an entire category of investments.</p>
<p>The Sharpe ratio has been one of the most popular risk/return measures in finance, not least because it's so simple to use. It also helped that Professor Sharpe won a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1990 for his work on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).</p>
<p>The Sharpe ratio is usually calculated for a portfolio and uses the risk-free interest rate as benchmark. We will simplify our example and use stocks instead of a portfolio. We will also use a stock index as benchmark rather than the risk-free interest rate because both are readily available at daily frequencies and we do not have to get into converting interest rates from annual to daily frequency. Just keep in mind that you would run the same calculation with portfolio returns and your risk-free rate of choice, e.g, the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS">3-month Treasury Bill Rate</a>. </p>
<p>So let's learn about the Sharpe ratio by calculating it for the stocks of the two tech giants Facebook and Amazon. As benchmark we'll use the S&amp;P 500 that measures the performance of the 500 largest stocks in the US. When we use a stock index instead of the risk-free rate, the result is called the Information Ratio and is used to benchmark the return on active portfolio management because it tells you how much more return for a given unit of risk your portfolio manager earned relative to just putting your money into a low-cost index fund.</p>

# The Android App Market on Google Play

<p>Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this notebook, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.</p>

# TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game

<p>Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's a little something for everyone at your Super Bowl party. Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes <a href="https://youtu.be/ZD1QrIe--_Y?t=14">riding giant mechanical tigers</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/mjrdywp5nyE?t=62">leaping from the roof of the stadium</a>. It's a show, baby. And in this notebook, we're going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. After exploring and cleaning our data a little, we're going to answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the most extreme game outcomes?</li>
<li>How does the game affect television viewership?</li>
<li>How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?</li>
<li>Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?</li>
</ul>
